 Skigear- is eCommerce store for selling ski stuff.
In this project, I developed frontend using Angular 9, Bootstrap and backend using .NET CORE, MySQL and Redis for cashing and storage ( https://github.com/slava-sapir/skigear ). 
Also, Stripe is integrated for credit cards payments. The project is published to Linux server on DigitalOcean - http://theskigear.com
